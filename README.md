# Simple-Calculator

The way it works is:

1. Enter number a
2. Enter operation
3. Enter number b
4. Hit = for an answer
5. You can also type in another operation and the previous expression will be evaluated.
6. Then continue

After pressing = sign, you can also continue from there and add another operation to continue from. You don't need to clear.
